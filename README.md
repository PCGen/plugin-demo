# plugin-demo
Working on a decoupled plugin architecture.

I believe all classes are well documented, but feel free to contact me with questions.

The build will create a zip with the files needed to run the demo.

# Running the demo:
* Build the project.
* Extract the demo.zip file.
* Either run run.bat or run.sh as appropriate for your OS.
* Add or remove Mode Plugins from the libs folder before running the script to notice modes showing or not in the UI.
